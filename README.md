HypeSign
========

This is a little Twitter bot powering a 2x16 LED sign. Anything tweeted to
@HypeSign29 will be displayed on this board in our house.

The Dockerfile configures the application to run on a Rpi, so it won't work
on non ARM architecture.

IPs are also hardcoded, sorry

Create a src/credentials.json with your Twitter creds
